# Decision_tree_from_scratch

This project implements a simple regression decision tree without external libraries for modeling. It generates synthetic linear data, builds a tree recursively to minimize variance, and visualizes predictions.

## Features

- Generates dummy regression data
- Calculates variance reduction for splits
- Recursively builds tree nodes
- Makes predictions on new data
- Plots regression predictions

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
